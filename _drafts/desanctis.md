1) I started working and experimenting with Azure since the very first days (who remembers the management portal based on Silverlight??) and, month by month, I saw it growing, becoming bigger, more complete and powerful. It's an evolving platform, but with evolution come changes and doubts.

Think about the mobile PaaS offering, today: Mobile Services or Mobile Apps? Which one shall we pick? You start a new project, you want to build a mobile backend, and this is the number one recurring question. My team made no exception: the choice between the two is the usual tradeoff in dev's world, between old and stable vs. new and powerful: there's no doubt that eventually everyone will move to mobile apps, but understanding when it's the right time to do can be crucial for the project success.

So, what about this talk? Well, it will be a very practical one, that's for sure, we're going to write a lot of code to explore together some of the critical differences between those two services: we'll point out the different approach the App Service team is taking with Mobile Apps, highlight the new feature and some of the hassles which still remain unsolved.

The ultimate hope is that sharing my personal experience on the field, will be useful when the time will come to chose the PaaS for your mobile backend, so that you'll be able to take a wiser and perhaps more conscious decision.

2) I'm a Microsoft MVP in ASP.NET and I've been working with Microsoft's web stack since the first beta of ASP.NET.
I've been incredibly lucky to be part of many projects based on the Azure platform, ranging from startup size to the big enterprise.

Today I consult as a tech lead in one of the biggest companies in the UK and I'm a very proud member of the Azure Advisors.
