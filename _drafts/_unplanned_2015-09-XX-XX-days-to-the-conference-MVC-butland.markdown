We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **DDD, CQRS and testing with ASP.Net MVC** and we asked [Andy Butland](http://web-matters.blogspot.it/) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**:The topic I plan to cover in my session at the conference stems primarily from a process I went through around a year ago moving back into custom web application development from a period working mostly on CMS projects.  I wanted to try to distil information I'd been reading from a number of book and online sources, to try to find an appropriate architecture and set of techniques for the applications I was looking to build.  Something that followed best practices but wasn't overkill from a complex archeticture perspective for the projects.

In essence I found that whilst methods such as DDD (domain driven design) and CQRS (command query responsibility segregation) may often be considered as appropriate for very large scale applications, they have a lot of benefits when applied even for medium sized projects.  In the talk I plan to cover some of these techniques and how I've used them in order to produce what feels to me to be a clear, testable and maintainable code base.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I have been building websites and applications, primarily on the Microsoft stack, since the days of classic ASP. My tools of choice these days are ASP.Net MVC, SQL Server, Entity Framework, JavaScript and the CMS platforms Umbraco and EPiServer. I work at [Zone](http://www.thisiszone.com), a primarily UK based digital agency, where he heads up the .Net development team working on projects for Coca-Cola, Tesco, RSPB and other clients.

Although earning the Ryanair frequent flyer points by working from the London office every couple of weeks or so, I live in Bassano del Grappa, Italy, with a very short commute to my home office.
