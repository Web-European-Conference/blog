We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **Capture, record, clip, embed and play, search: video from newbie to ninja** and we asked [Vito Flavio Lorusso](https://twitter.com/vflorusso) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: This session is about understanding how you can use and leverage building blocks in the Azure Cloud to add video production features to your solutions.

Media management has been a very niche market for those who have premium content and required very expensive hardware.
In web sites the most use of Video you would do could be embedding a YouTube video in a web page or a Flash Media Player, but all the video preparation, the special effects and the authoring would be still left to professional people other than web developers as the video production and value chain was only possible with expensive authoring and streaming tools.

User driven content, better and lower priced cameras and the Cloud have democratized the video workflow and made it possible for developers to approach the full value chain of video without needing to dig into the details.
HTML5 has also enabled to reuse the same web development skills used for web applications, to rich video players and eventually video editing software, without needing to learn other languages and paradigms as those in Adobe Flash.

The story with Azure is even more compelling as there is no need to know how to install video capturing, processing and streaming software as the Azure Media Services platform offers anything that you need to ingest, transform and stream videos with nice REST APIs and specialized and easy to use SDKs for .Net, Java, PHP and more.

I will be covering how to manage with code video entities in the platform, how to stream live content and playback, some cool video processing features and eventually some rich video player experiences.
I will be using the familiar Asp.Net development language, but will share few examples with other languages.

Thatâ€™s how I hope I will get you interested in video and taking your first steps in becoming a video ninja
