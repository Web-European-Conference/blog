We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **Optimizing web apps using AppInsights, memory and performance profiling** and we asked [Maarten Balliauw](http://blog.maartenballiauw.be) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: The Web European Conference organizers have dubbed my session "Optimizing web apps using AppInsights, memory and performance profiling", but I kind of like the code name I use for it: *"Sherlock Homepage - A detective story about running large web services"*. Reason for that is that this session is a real detective story about our team working on several of the issues we in the past months building out [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org).

We'll start with a simple site outage and investigate the crime scene. We'll soon find out that nothing is what it seems, and that the prime suspect is still out there. We'll be using profilers, AppInsights and intuition to find out why this outage happened. We'll see tasks can be evil, and that having some knowledge about IIS, memory management and threading can help us catch our suspect.

Vague, I know, but I don't want to ruin the story - a story which you will only hear when attending Web European Conference!


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I am a web and cloud guy, two technologies I like to speak and [blog](http://blog.maartenballiauw.be) about. I work at Microsoft, building out the server-side of NuGet since a few months. Before, I've been a Microsoft Azure MVP and ASP Insider. I also co-founded [MyGet](http://www.myget.org), hosting private NuGet, npm and Bower feeds for teams.
