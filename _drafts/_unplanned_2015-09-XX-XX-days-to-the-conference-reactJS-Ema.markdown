We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **ReactJS in a real world application** and we asked [Emanuele DelBono](http://twitter.com/emadb) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: I'm using [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for almost a year now and after an initial skepticism I had fallen in love with it. And it's not only about react itself but all the environment and tools and communities around it.

During my session I would like to pass some of my enthusiasm to the people, I would like to show that in just one hour everybody will be able to write a complete app. React is easy, is not magic, is _what you write is what you get_.

I will give a brief introduction of the basic concepts on which react is based and then I will show the support tools and libraries that are useful to write complex applications. In the end I will try to write some React components so that people will be able to see how easy it is and how a real world application should be developed.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I'm a software developer, I work in [CodicePlastico](http://codiceplastico.com) a small software house formed by seven superhero-developers. I develop mostly web applications in ASP.NET and Node.js. I like crafting application using basic tools: a terminal, some scripts and an editor. I love to learn new tools, languages and practices. During the last year I've became a fan of frontend developer, previously with Angular and now with React.
