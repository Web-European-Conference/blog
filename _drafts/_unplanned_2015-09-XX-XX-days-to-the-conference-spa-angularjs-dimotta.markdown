We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **Create a single page web application with AngularJS** and we asked [Antonio Di Motta](http://www.dimotta.net/) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: My session will have AngularJS as main actor. We will go to understand the main characteristics of this web framework that makes simple building a Single Page Application but also how to extend the built-in directives with your own custom. To do that, we will see many examples with different levels of difficulty. There will be space also to understand how to design a complex SPA project by reference to an open source project I'm working on.

This session requires a good knowledge of html and javascript, as well as concepts like data-binding and mvc should be familiar.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I'm working at Mate Consulting as IT Project Engineer. In my career i have had the opportunity to work on interesting projects that have involved the real life. Itâ€™s amazing when you see your software working into an industrial or transportation plant like a metro, every decision about the design and implementation are very important and have a deep impact to the final results. I like sharing my knowledge with others and the open source its a great way to accomplish it, so i have an account on [Github](http://Github.com/antdimot) which is the place where I'm publishing some personal projects.
