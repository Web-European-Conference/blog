##Session: gulp

Do you like preprocessing or minifying your css or javascript files with some tool you found, then updating your browser, refresh to see the results. No? Well, me neither. Luckily I found gulp.js, a great node.js based task runner that takes out those pesky tasks I needed to perform after each edit.  
Gulp saved me time and helped me to focus on what I need to be doing: writing applications for the end users. This session will give you an introduction to gulp.js as well as nice takeaways you can add to your current or future project. Don't miss out on this one.
