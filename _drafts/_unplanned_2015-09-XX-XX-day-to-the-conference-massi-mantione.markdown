We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **You Can Have it Both Ways: Using Web Components in a React UI>** and we asked [Massimiliano Mantione](https://twitter.com/M_a_s_s_i) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: I decided to prepare this talk because I had a question that needed an answer: is it possible to use Web Components in a React-based web application?

I definitely love React, mostly for the kind of functional programming that it enables building UIs on the client side.
But I also see that Web Components are here to stay: they are not just "yet another web framework", they are positioned to become literally the future of the DOM.
So, even if I love React, I cannot ignore them...

In this talk we'll give a clear answer to the question above. After that we'll also see how much Web Components "play nice" in an a very functional React environment, including hot reloading and a time-traveling debugging tool.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**:I am a software engineer at heart.

I am mostly interested in programming languages and compilers (I have worked in the V8 team in Google for 1.5 years and on the Mono JIT for almost 6 years), and these days in scalable cloud-based architectures.
