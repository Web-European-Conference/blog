In less than 10 days the Web European Conference will kick off, and to help you make the most of it, starting from today we'll feature one (or more) talks a day so that you can choose which talks to follow.

The first featured session is **Going Further with ASP.NET 5** and we asked [Tugberk Ugurlu](http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: With this session, we will go a little further with ASP.NET 5 and look under the hood a bit to cover the advanced cases like several extensibility points, hooking into compilation, new authorization/authentication components and concepts, in-memory end-to-end testing with samples and a few more. We’ll also have a chance to see some end-to-end project examples, demonstrating how your workflows and coding might change, and some corner case issues and gotchas you might hit. Generally, this talk will broaden your understanding of what will be possible with ASP.NET 5, and you’ll know where to look if you want to get one step closer to mastery.

This session assumes that you have a prior knowledge on ASP.NET 5, and know how it’s different from its previous versions. If you want to benefit from this session and haven't got the chance to get up to speed wıth ASP.NET 5 yet, here are a few links to help you:

### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I am a web guy, Microsoft MVP and software developer specialized mainly on .NET Web technologies. I worked in the tourism industry to build tourism software services and products for long time and now, I'm working at Redgate Software as a Software Engineer helping people do database delivery in a joyful way. I am also very involved in the community and I like to share my knowledge with others through [my blog](http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/), webcasts, authoring books, giving talks on various topics and so on.
