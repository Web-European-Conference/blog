A bit less than 3 days and still 5 sessions to feature: the first of the last group of session is **Gulp** and we asked [Kris van der Mast](http://www.krisvandermast.com/) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

With this we completed all the session for the time-slot between 14:00 and 15:00. So you can start making up your mind on what to follow after lunch:

 - Track 1: [Optimizing web apps using AppInsights, memory and performance profiling by Maarten Balliauw](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/16/10-days-to-the-conference-appinsight-maarten/)
 - Track 2: [Extending RWD with Lightweight Client-side Device Detection by Dino Esposito](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/20/06-days-to-the-conference-dino-esposito/)
 - Track 3: [DDD, CQRS and testing with ASP.Net MVC by Andy Butland](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/18/08-days-to-the-conference-MVC-butland/)
 - Track 4: [Gulp by Kris van der Mast](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/23/03-days-to-the-conference-gulp-KrisVDM/)

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: Do you like preprocessing or minifying your css or javascript files with some tool you found, then updating your browser, refresh to see the results. No? Well, me neither. Luckily I found gulp.js, a great node.js based task runner that takes out those pesky tasks I needed to perform after each edit.  

Gulp saved me time and helped me to focus on what I need to be doing: writing applications for the end users. This session will give you an introduction to gulp.js as well as nice takeaways you can add to your current or future project. Don't miss out on this one.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: Kris van der Mast is a Microsoft MVP and ASP + Azure Insider. He likes to learn new things and pass on that knowledge. Coming from Belgium he likes beer and chocolate but doesn't say no to a tasty Italian wine or tiramisu either.
