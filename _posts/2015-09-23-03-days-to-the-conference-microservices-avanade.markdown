Just 3 days, the featured session is **Micro Interactions & Microservices - Little things matter** and we asked to the two presenters, [Roberto Nocera](https://twitter.com/noce2k) and Angelo Oldani to tell us more about his session and about himself.

With this session we have featured 4 sessions per slot and from this afternoon we'll be filling in the last option for each of the slots.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: This session could be seen as the black sheep of the conference for two reasons!  
The first one is that this speech will be held by two guys who have different roles in Avanade: Angelo, the Experience Designer and Roberto, the Solution Architect.

The other reason is that in this presentation you will not hear just about code, .net technologies and MVP; there will be design, details and emotions as well.

This blending is our response of new people’s needs; right now users are expecting rich, immersive and dynamic experiences.

In this speech we would like to tell you how design and development can accommodate those expectations and how they can cooperate together in order to achieve better results. In both sides, design and development, two trends are emerging: Microinteractions and Microservices.

Angelo will tell about Microinteractions a new way to think how we can design details in digital product and services; as the famous designer Charles Eames said: “The details are not the details. They make the product.”

Roberto will talk about Microservices and how new technical solutions are able to achieve the huge challenges in which we are involved today. To understand why Microservices is as much about team organizational attitude as it's about technological attitude come to session.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: Angelo designs systems, interfaces and services that follow the guide- lines of User-Centered Design methodology, focusing on user interaction and producing involving emotional experiences
