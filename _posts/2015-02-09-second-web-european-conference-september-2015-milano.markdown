As [anticipated some time ago](/2014/07/28/announcing-second-web-european-conference/) we were working on the 2nd edition of the [Web European Conference](http://webnextconf.eu/).

Today we are finally able to announce the actual date and location: the [2nd Web European Conference](http://webnextconf.eu/) will be held in **Milano**, the **26 September 2015**.

Thanks to the hospitaly of the [University of Milano-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it/go/102/Home/English) the conference will be free to attend, but we'll need your help to make it the best conference ever. 

### Call for presenters

To make an awesome conference we need awesome speakers, and today we are also launching the call for presenters: if you want to propose a talk that matches the ideas of our Manifest, you can already submit your proposal. Go on our [Github account](https://github.com/Web-European-Conference), fork the [c4p repository](https://github.com/Web-European-Conference/c4p), add your proposal and submit a pull request.

### Call for sponsors

And we also need awesome partners and sponsors: if your company embraces our manifesto, and want to be part of this conference, please contact us via the contact form available on our [website](http://webnextconf.eu).

### Call for volunteers

Finally, if you cannot give a speech but still want to be part of this event, we need you anyway: if you want to volunteer on the day of the event helping with registration, video recordings, time-keeping or also want to help before the event, with the site and the organization process, please contact us via the contact form available on our [website](http://webnextconf.eu).
