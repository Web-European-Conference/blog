### Hotel discounts and logistics

I guess many of you are already planning their trip to Milano, and for this we secured some discounts in hotels near the conference venue.

The first hotel is [**Hotel Arcimboldi**](https://www.hotelarcimboldi.it/), just a few minutes walk from the venue. We'll have a 15% discount by specifying the code **EUROPEAN WEB CONFERENCE** when booking via email at [arcimboldi@bookingsolutions.it](mailto:arcimboldi@bookingsolutions.it).

Same conditions also for the second hotel [**Idea Hotel Bicocca**](http://www.ideahotel.it/): 15% discount by specifying the code **EUROPEAN WEB CONFERENCE** when booking via email at [bicocca@bookingsolutions.it ](mailto:bicocca@bookingsolutions.it).

**How to get to Milano**:

There are 3 airports in Milano: Malpensa, Linato, Orio al Serio (Bergamo).
They are all more or less 50-70 minutes with public transports from Milano City Center, and the all cost between 6 and 12 euro.

* From Malpensa:
Once you arrive at the airport just follow the sign for [Malpensa Express](http://www.malpensaexpress.it/en/). There is a train every 30 minutes from 6am till 1:30am. You will arrive in Milano Central Station or in Milano Cadorna. And from there you have access to the subway.

You can also take the [Malpensa Shuttle](http://www.malpensashuttle.it/) a bus that will take you to Milano Central Station.

* From Linate:
Public Bus n 72. This will take you to Piazza San Babila, a few minutes walk from Duomo, and with access to subway.
You can also take the [Air bus](http://www.atm.it/en/AltriServizi/Trasporto/Pages/airbus.aspx) that will take you to Milano Central Station.

* From Orio al Serio (Bergamo):

### Aperitivo

Big announcement: we are pleased to announce that the evening before the event, Friday 25th September, you'll have the chance to experience the traditional "Aperitivo alla Milanese" (Milan style happy-hour) which means that you'll have a buffet supper (and these can be both hot and cold dishes, pasta, pizza, focaccia, cheese, sausages and so on) that you get for free when buying a drink.
If you ordered lunch or t-shirt for the conference, one of your drinks will be on us, which means that you'll eat and drink (one drink per person) for free: another reason to buy lunch for the conference.

Details will come later in August.
