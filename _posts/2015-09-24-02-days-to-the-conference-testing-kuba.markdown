Just 2 days to the Conference: are you excited as much as we are?

If not yet, here is a session that should get you excited, becuase **seriously, you should start testing that JavaScript code**! We asked [Kuba Walinski](http://twitter.com/kubawalinski) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

Just before the afternoon's coffee break, from 15:00 to 16:00, you can choose among the following sessions:

- Track 1: [ Capture, record, clip, embed and play, search: video from newbie to ninja by Vito Flavio Lorusso](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/19/07-days-to-the-conference-azure-video-vito-lorusso/)
- Track 2: [Seriously, you should start testing that JavaScript code byKuba Walinski](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/24/02-days-to-the-conference-testing-kuba/)
- Track 3: [OData v4: the easy way of exposing and querying structured data by Raffaele Rialdi](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/20/06-days-to-the-conference-odata-raf/)
- Track 4: [React.js in a real world application by Emanuele DelBono](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/18/08-days-to-the-conference-reactJS-Ema/)

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: I will be doing my best to convince you that you should have some automated testing set up for your JavaScript code. This can have the form of linting, which will help you avoid some basic errors related to language syntax and style. It can also entail running unit tests on every build of your app, which I can't recommend enough. Ideally you should employ both of those techniques and probably even add some integration (end-2-end) tests for good measure. In my session I will show you how to configure all this test automation using grunt or gulp - the 2 most popular build tools for frontend projects.

Finally, I will be showing a bunch of real unit tests from one of my earlier projects. I also plan to share some of my thoughts and insights on using ES2015 and JSPM.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I have recently quit my corporate job and started my own software services company together with all the other members of my former team. Our company is called "Happy Team" (https://twitter.com/happyteamio) and we are currently developing a brand new eCommerce service for a big client in the UK. Because this project has a really tight deadline (we have to release it well before the Christmas shopping spree) we decided to go with a technology we already knew instead of trying out something new. That's how we ended up doing it in AngularJS and this is one of the reasons why I will be talking about AngularJS during my session at Web European Conf.

In my free time I usually play football or go for a bike ride in the woods. I often listen to audiobooks, right now I am in the middle of "Metro 2034" and I enjoy it immensely.
