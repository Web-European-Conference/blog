The only session about mobile development of this conference is the one featured today, with just 4 days to wait before the conference starts: **Rapid Mobile Development with Ionic framework** and we asked [Alessio Delmonti](https://twitter.com/alexintosh) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

But if you are not into mobile development, on the first session after [Scott's keynote](), you choose to learn about the new [ASP.NET 5](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/15/11-day-to-the-conference/), or [ReactJS with WebComponents](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/19/07-days-to-the-conference-massi-mantione/).

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: The aim of this session is to give a complete overview about what is ionic framework, why is a valid option for the rapid cross-platform development and how to get started quickly.

We will start exploring the framework's architecture and his components, then we will go ahead to the installation process and the explanation of the project structure.

We will use the demo app to discuss best practices and good habits in a real life apps, how to solve some common performance issues and some useful tool and plugins to solve common problems in Cordova apps.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I am mostly interested in software development and entrepreneurship, in the past 7 years I've worked for different startups, in 2013 I co-founded my own first company Wiralist where I worked as CTO until 2015.

During the last six months I've has been traveling between Europe and Silicon Valley and now I'm based in London and working as ionic-enthusiast in Voyage control.
