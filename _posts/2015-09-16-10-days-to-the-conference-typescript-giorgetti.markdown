We are continuing our tour of the sessions: with 10 days the Web European Conference, the featured session is **TypeScript: the JavaScript developer best friend!** and we asked [Alessandro Giorgetti](http://www.primordialcode.com/) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: Let's pin with some strong points on the language:

 - JavaScript is one of the few true cross platform languages we have around today.
 - JavaScript is widely adopted and it's available nearly on any device these days.
 - JavaScript can - thanks to nodejs and similar projects - run even server side.
 - JavaScript is a powerful, flexible and dynamic language.
 - Learning JavaScript is quite easy (mastering it, is a whole another thing).

And some drawbacks:

 - It's a dynamic and loosely typed language: great flexibility, but you can harm yourself in a very bad way!
 - Refactoring is a nightmare!
 - Tooling sucks badly!

In today's world developing a software, a website or whatever you do, among all the other things it is also the 'art of optimizing limited resources'.

If you think about it, we have limited resources in terms of:
 - People that belong to our development team.
 - Time spent on design and coding of each person involved.

If you - like me - do not want to waste your time in useless tasks when starting (or taking control of)  a project, you start with an assessment session in which you look around at all the languages that are used and which tools are available to ease your job out (and possibly avoid the juniors to make disasters to recover later).

Dealing with JavaScript, a big part of the problem is the lack of good tooling due to the dynamic nature of the language itself. To avoid common and stupid mistakes you usually need:
 - A good coding style guide.
 - The discipline to enforced that on the team.
 - A huge test suite to spot all the 'stupid' mistakes like mistyping a property.

Wouldn't be better if the language (and the tooling) could help us enable some of the rules - with explicit evidence of where the problem is and maybe a hint on how to correct it - and avoid us to lose time writing useless tests, while we should focus on design?

TypeScript does just that!  
It's a superset of JavaScript that enforces coherence rules bringing in strong typing; it helps developer structure their 'JavaScript code' with interfaces, classes and inheritance (built upon prototypical inheritance), namespaces and modules: all the familiar constructs you have usually available in an Object Oriented language.
Tooling is spectacular (compared to what we were used to have in plain JavaScript): it enables a fantastic intellisense support and Refactoring is not a nightmare anymore!
It extends the actual JavaScript with features that will be available natively in the vNext.

And the best thing is: all of there are just development-time artifacts! TypeScript compiles (transpiles) to plain old 'comfortable' JavaScript to be fed to our browsers or runtimes. And the JavaScript it emits conform to the highest standards and best practices.

In short:  
TypeScript helps me to be a better JavaScript developer, and it saves me time and headaches along the way. This is why this session will be cool!

### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I'm a 'software craftsman' specialized in enterprise applications for the healthcare system, with focus on service oriented applications. I have experiences in different programming languages like: C#, C++, Javascript, TypeScript... and several technologies and frameworks like .NET, ASP.NET MVC, NodeJS, HTML5, AngularJS, Nhibernate, NEventStore. I'm one of the founders and an active speaker of the .Net user group DotNetMarche. I'm also a founder and the Community Group DevMarche. Away from my normal job I've discovered (too late maybe) a passion for fitness and BBQ cooking, two things that play well together!
