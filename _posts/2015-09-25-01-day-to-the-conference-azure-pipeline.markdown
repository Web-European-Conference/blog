Tomorrow at this time you'll be probably already registering at the conference location, but maybe you haven't made up your mind yet. The last session of the day will be **Short Introduction and methodes for Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions** and we asked [Davide Persetti](http://www.pipeline.it/) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

The last session of the day has to be chosen wisely, otherwise you might fall asleep after a long day at the conference. Here your options:

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: In this session, and with the help of a colleague of mine, we’re going to talk a little bit of developing applications in Microsoft Azure that is the Microsoft cloud platform. Before showing some examples we’ll try to set the scene giving an overview of the various cloud models existing nowadays; so the session will be a mix of theory and practice with the aim of giving an overview of the most important concepts to consider.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: Pre-sale and Project manager in the cloud area with a specific focus on the Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure platforms. Through the adoption of Microsoft Azure I try to help customers to start and move to the cloud world with native or hybrid solutions, integrating on-premise and in-cloud resources.
