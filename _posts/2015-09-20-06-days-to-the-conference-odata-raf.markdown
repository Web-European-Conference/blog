One more featured session for this Sunday: **OData v4: the easy way of exposing and querying structured data** and we asked [Raffaele Rialdi](<link>) to tell us more about his session and about himself.

Together with [Capture, record, clip, embed and play, search: video from newbie to ninja by Vito Flavio Lorusso](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/19/07-days-to-the-conference-azure-video-vito-lorusso/) and [ReactJS in a real world application by Emanuele DelBono](http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/09/18/08-days-to-the-conference-reactJS-Ema/), this will be the second session of the afternoon, just before the coffee break. Which one will you choose? Video on Azure, ReactJS or OData?

### Q: Tell us a bit more about your session
**A**: In my professional life I design and write code, which result in facing up to everyday problems with the teams I work with.

These realities do impose constraints in terms of whitelisted/blacklisted libraries, coding practices, software and tools versions and not last delivery times.

Many conference sessions are about pure theory, which is nice but often clash with the everyday problems. My job is also about finding the right balance and satisfying the requirements.

OData is one perfect example for this balancing. From a pure technological standpoint we would love to *always* work with pure REST solutions but in the real life sometimes we need a sort of *fast lane* that allows to solve big problems with simple technology.

Most of my session talks more about the *design perspective* where the code is still the king because software architecture is indeed about writing real code.


### Q: Tell us a bit more about yourself
**A**: I love solving problems, my thoughts are always in a sort of "*life hacking*" mode. Computing is probably the best and more natural way to satisfy my mind.
Usually I do not like gaming, I love writing code even in my spare time. My passion began with hardware and I consider myself a maker as I still spend time with the solder, micro-controllers and sensors.

However, at the very end modern digital hardware need software, which comes back to writing code.

As a father, I tend not to push my son and my daughter into my world because coding software is delightful if you love it, otherwise is pure nightmare.
