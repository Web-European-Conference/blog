You all already know the date of the conference, the 26 September 2015. Now there is another important date to mark on your calendar: **1st July 2015**, at noon, the registration for the conference will open.

In the previous edition, we filled in the capacity of the venue (170 seats) in less than one hour: this year we'll have a bigger venue, with more than 400 seats, but if you want to get your seats for this free conference, be on the site on time.

If you attended the previous edition, you'll be able to pre-register before the official registration opens. Also if you are registered to our mailining list you'll have an head-start. So, go to our website [http://webnextconf.eu/](http://webnextconf.eu/ "http://webnextconf.eu/") and subscribe to the mailing list.

### Speakers

Today we are very happy to announce that we've secured two amazing speakers: [**Scott Hanselman**](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [**Dino Esposito**](https://twitter.com/despos) will be speaking at the Web European Conference.

### Call for presenters

So far we received almost 50 proposals from 20+ different speakers, but to get even more speeches to choose from, we've decided to keep the call for presenters open till the end of June: if you haven't done it yet and you want have the chance to be in the "speakers room" with Scott, go on our [Github account](https://github.com/Web-European-Conference), fork the [c4p repository](https://github.com/Web-European-Conference/c4p), add your proposal and submit a pull request.
